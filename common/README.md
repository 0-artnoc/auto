Auto Common Utilities
========

The Auto project has a set of common utilities to help ease use of the annotation processing environment. 

In particular:

  * MoreTypes - utilities and Equivalence wrappers for TypeMirror and related subtypes
  * MoreElements - utilities for Element and related subtypes
  * SuperficialValidation - very simple scanner to ensure an Element is valid and free from distortion from upstream compilation errors
  * Visibility - utilities for working with Elements' visibility levels (public, protected, etc.)
