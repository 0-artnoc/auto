Auto
======

A collection of source code generators for [Java][java].

Autoâ€½
-----

[Java][java] is full of code that is mechanical, repetitive, typically untested and sometimes the source of subtle bugs. _Sounds like a job for robots!_

The Auto subprojects are a collection of code generators that automate those types of tasks. They create the code you would have written, but without the bugs.

Save time.  Save code.  Save sanity.

Subprojects
-----------

  * [AutoFactory](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/factory) - JSR-330-compatible factories
  * [AutoService](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/service) - Automatically generated provider-configuration files for [`ServiceLoader`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
  * [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value) - Java [value objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object) from minimal code.
